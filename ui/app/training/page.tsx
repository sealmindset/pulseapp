PULSE is a proven methodology designed specifically for high-value products. Unlike traditional sales approaches that can feel pushy or transactional, PULSE focuses on building genuine connections and understanding your customer's real needs.

The five steps are: Probe, Understand, Link, Solve, and Earn. Each step builds on the previous one, creating a natural conversation flow that customers appreciate.

Whether you're new to sales or have years of experience, PULSE will help you significantly improve your conversion rates while making customers feel valued and understood.

Let's begin your journey to becoming a trusted advisor, not just a salesperson. Select your experience level to get started!`;
